What are the Big-5-personality traits, and how are they suitable?

Five- Factor-Model FFM is a set of personality traits commonly used in psychology. These traits are as follows:
Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism. 
Each person has a unique set and can be represented across a spectrum. These traits have been known to be the most accurate in depicting human personalities. A lot of research has validated their accuracy. However, no personality can be 100 per cent and represented accurately.

To put it into more accurate words this platform is a more personalized version of ChatGpt, as it has prior knowledge of your personality scores.

Furthermore, this platform can be used to answer personalized behavioural questions and generate a short paragraph that can be added to resumes or personal statements.
